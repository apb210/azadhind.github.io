                                        The history of India’s freedom struggle is complex as <ib>opposed</ib>  to
                                            the largely accepted <ib>view that the non-violent opposition</ib> spearheaded by Mahatma Gandhi was the 
                                            <ib>sole factor</ib> factor that led to India’s independence from British rule. 
                                            Gandhi's role is somewhat retrenched by Clement Attlee’s
                                            statement [<a href="#R1">1</a>] on the role of the non-violent movement 
                                            in driving the British to <ib>leave India hastily was minimal</ib>, and that 
                                            <ib>erosion of loyalty</ib> to the crown among the Indian Army 
                                                and Navy because of Netaji Subhas Bose’s military activities was the principal cause.
                                            However, neither the non-violent movement nor the sustained armed resistance can be <ib>meaningfully 
                                                comprehended without each other</ib>, and a <ib>holistic approach</ib>

                                                    the revolutionary armed movement during the World War 2 with political and military

                                                and shed light upon conceptualization, trials, and final execution of the armed 
                                                struggle for Indian independence whose psychological impact shook the foundations of the
                                                British rule in India and hastily precipitated independence. It must be stated that
                                                a hasty independence was not favorable for India due to the horrors of holocaust that ensued
                                                because of partitioning the subcontinent based on religious lines. A brief timeline is provided.

                                        British colonial conquests in the Indian subcontinent faced military opposition from 
                                        local nobility and traditional social groups between 1757 and 1857. 
                                        This precipitated the Revolt of 1857-59 that was crushed by the British. 
                                        India came under the crown and natives and rulers of kingdoms were 
                                        forced to accept political subjugation by the British.
                                        However, for the first time since Clive's victory in 1757, the British experienced
                                        mass violence from a diverse group of people rising against their hegemonic attitudes. 
                                        Extremely cautious, it took the British government 20 years                                     
                                        to formally declare Queen Victoria as the Empress of India in 1877. By then, a formal 
                                        modality of freedom struggle was beginning to take shape, espoused by <ib>Ganesh 
                                            Vasudeo Joshi's</ib>  statement in the Proclamation Durbar, 
                                        asking QV to <ib>grant the Indians same rights as her British subjects </ib>[<a href="#R2">2</a>].

                                        After the death of between 
                                        5-9 million native Indians [<a href="#R3">3</a>] in the raging <ib>famine of 1876-78</ib>, 
                                        Allan Octavian Hume, with extreme desperation, established in 1885, a common platform, 
                                        the <ib>Indian National Congress (INC)</ib> to discuss 
                                        and debate the Indian state-of-affairs. While British <ib>economic policies and 
                                        territorial campaigns  emaciated</ib> 
                                        the subcontinent, the INC was merely a show, for, the first president was a servile anglophile, 
                                        W.C. Bonnerjee who lived the life of an Englishman and even <ib>ridiculed</ib> any form of political dissent
                                        [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Nonetheless, the INC eventually, grew beyond a 
                                        debating society in the late 1890s due to the emergence of new leaders, in particular 
                                        <ib>Bal Gangadhar Tilak</ib>, who could put forward Indian demands with new aggression. </p>

                                        The famines, epidemics and political mobilization of Tilak 
                                        provided the <ib>broader political context</ib> for active dissent 
                                        evidenced by the <ib>assassination of the plague commissioner of Poona</ib>, 
                                        Walter Rand, by the <ib>Chapekar brothers</ib> in 1897. This act was a 
                                        <ib>revenge</ib> against the British indifference to Indian customs and values. 
                                        A <ib>bubonic plague </ib> was raging through Poona during 1895-96, and 
                                        under Rand\’s instructions, constables raided homes, burnt down property, molested women, and <ib>desecrated religious shrines</ib>. 
                                        Chapekar brothers were eventually <ib>tried and executed</ib> which made them martyrs. 
                                        Additionally, Tilak's arrest made him a popular leader among growing nationalist movements in 
                                        other presidencies as well. Although the Chapekar brothers were <ib>not a part of any broader network</ib>, 
                                        it is widely accepted that this <ib>incident gave rise to the spirit of revolutionary

                                        As a consequence of rising nationalism in the subcontinent, 
                                        the British implemented the controversial <ib>Partition of Bengal in 
                                        1905</ib> to disrupt the feeling of unity among the two major religious
                                        communities in the Bengal province - the Hindus and the Muslims.

                                        Eventually, under V. D. Savarkar's leadership, India House 
                                        became a meeting-ground for radical revolutionaries 
                                        among Indian students in Britain.

                                        It was Savarkar who introduced the spirit of collective 
                                        revolt espoused in the uprising of 1857 and published a 
                                        book titled <i><ib>Indian War of Independence </ib></i>.
                                        Savarkar wrote passionately about how native Indians rose 
                                        above religious differences to 
                                        fight against colonial hegemony. For the first time
                                        the revolt of 1857 was studied critically in detail and

                                                    of the destructive part of the revolution was complete, 
                                                    its creative part was not attractive enough. 
                                                    Nobody was against destroying their English power; 
                                                    But what about the future? If it was only to re-establish 
                                                    the former internecine strife, if it was to bring again

                                                    for this, the more ignorant of the populace did not think

                                        The fate of India House was sealed when in 1909

                                        to the Secretary of State for India. 
                                        Curzon Wyllie was regarded in <i>The Indian Sociologist</i>
                                        in October 1907, as one of "old unrepentant foes of India

                                        since they began their career". Additionally, he was head 
                                        of Secret Police and collected substantial intelligence
                                        on Indian radicalist opinion that was finding voice
                                        in contemporary Britain. 
                                        In the aftermath of the assassination, India House was suppressed
                                        and its leadership fled to Europe (Germany and France) and the United States

                                        nearly <ib>impossible</ib> for those <ib>coming from India</ib> due 
                                        to the distance and <ib>lack of direct shipping routes</ib>.

                                        Upon arrival, the passengers <ib>not even allowed 
                                            to disembark</ib>. The ship <ib>remained in the 
                                                harbor for two months</ib>, during which the passengers 
                                        faced challenging conditions with <ib>limited access 
                                            to food and water</ib>. The <ib>local South Asian community </ib>
                                        tried to provide assistance, but their <ib>efforts were 
                                            blocked</ib> by the authorities.

                                        Eventually, the <ib>ship was forced to return to India.</ib>
                                        Upon arriving in Calcutta (now Kolkata), British authorities 
                                        saw the <ib>passengers as potential political agitators</ib>
                                        primarily because of the political uneasiness it caused in 
                                        Canada and that it was chartered by a member of the Ghadar party
                                        [<a href="#R11">11</a>].
                                        In a confrontation with police, 19 passengers were 
                                        killed, and many others were arrested or injured.
                                        
                                        The Kamagata Maru incident <ib>inflamed passions</ib> and gave 
                                        a massive <ib>boost to the cause</ib> of the Ghadar movement.
                                        It made the case of <ib>racial injustice and oppression</ib>
                                        faced by Indians abroad.  Right after this event, a 
                                        few members of the Ghadar party 
                                        including <ib>Ganesh Vishnu Pingle, Satyen Bhushan Sen and
                                            Kartar Singh Sarabha,</ib> sailed to India in October 1914. 
                                        Satyen Bhushan Sen was the <ib>emissary of Jatindranath Mukherjee</ib>
                                        in the Ghadar party. The aim of the Ghadar party now 
                                        became to join forces with Indian revolutionaries of 
                                        <ib>Anushilan Samiti and
                                            Jugantar </ib>and incite a <ib>revolution across multiple barracks</ib> in 
                                        the British empire.

                                        Right after, World War 1 broke out that provided a 
                                        strategic opportunity to the revolutionaries. Upon `
                                        return to India, <ib>Ganesh Pingle met with Jatin Mukherjee</ib>
                                        through Satyen Bhushan Sen and was <ib>introduced to 
                                            Rashbehari Bose</ib> in exile in Bangalitola, Benares. 
                                        The Revolutionary movement found a <ib>new and effective
                                            leader in Rashbehari Bose</ib>, who along with other members
                                        of <ib>Anushilan Samiti in Bengal and Ghadar branch in the Punjab </ib>,
                                        made strategic and intricate <ib>plans of smuggling arms
                                            into India</ib> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Larsen_affair">Annie Larsen Affair</a>), 
                                            made effective bombs and met secretly 
                                        with native Indian leaders of Indian barracks to
                                        organize mutinies. 
                                        However, the plans fell through because of betrayal and British
                                        intelligence efforts. The <ib>Singapore 
                                            mutiny of February 1915</ib> at Tanglin Barracks  [<a href="#R12">12</a>], 
                                        was perhaps the only event that was impactful, 
                                        but was suppressed and the mutineers were executed.
                                        Key members including Pingle were arrested, in March 1915,
                                        and <ib>Rashbehari Bose escaped to Japan</ib>.

                                        In World War I, several <ib>native Indian soldiers of Islamic faith</ib>
                                        fought on behalf of the Allies, primarily from the British side. Several
                                        of these soldiers were captured by the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary,
                                        Bulgaria and the Ottoman empire). These <ib>Muslim PoWs were housed in the
                                            Halbmondlager camp in Zossen</ib>, Germany where they were <ib>ideologically
                                                motivated </ib>to wage <i>Jihad</i> against the Allied forces.

                                        been used as <ib>Gateway to India</ib>
                                        and disrupting the British influence on the neutrality of Afghanistan in WW1 was the focus of 
                                        revolutionary thinkers. With this aim, the <ib>Kabul mission </ib>

                                        was sent to Afghanistan to <ib>influence the Emir</ib> declare full independence 
                                        and <ib>enter the war on the side of the Central Powers</ib>. It was led 
                                        by <ib>Raja Mahendra Pratap</ib> and members of the Berlin Committee. 
                                        Britain saw this expedition as a <ib>serious threat</ib> and

                                        important events such as campaigns against the tribes who were
                                        against the Emir's support of the British. Additionally,

                                        became ideologically favorable towards the idea of <i>Jihad</i> against the British

                                        <h3>Post World War 1</h3>

                                        After the conclusion of World War I, the British passed anti-sedition laws,
                                        specificially, <ib>the Rowlatt Acts</ib>, that authorized British government to imprison any 
                                        person <ib>suspected of terrorism or revolutionary activity without trial</ib> 
                                        and to detain them for up to two years. When a peaceful protest was 
                                        taking place against the Rowlatt Acts, in Jallianwala Bagh in April 1919, 
                                        General Dyer with his regiment consisting of native Indian sepoys surrounded 
                                        these protesters, blocked all the exits, and fired several rounds of ammunition 
                                        killing nearly 1300 men women and children [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. This vile act came to be regarded 
                                        as the

                                        </a> and gave impetus to both eventual revolutionary 
                                        activities and the Gandhian non-cooperation movements.

                                        By the end of WWI, Gandhi entered Indian politics. 
                                        Since then, <ib>Gandhian non-violent non-cooperation
                                            movements dominated the narrative </ib> of
                                        Indian freedom movement up until the 1930s where several important 
                                        legislative decisions on India would be made.
                                        While the siege of Kut-Al-Amara had a profound impact
                                        on the revolutionary movement led by <ib>Raja Mahendra Pratap</ib>,
                                        Gandhi leveraged the incident to launch the 
                                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khilafat_Movement">
                                            Khilafat Movement
                                        </a> in 1919. This is one of several instances where
                                        singular events have been leveraged by <ib>two ideologically
                                            different </ib> narratives of the Indian freedom movement, 
                                            and perhaps makes a strong case against the adoption 
                                            of a singular dominant narrative to explain history.

                                        By 1920, <ib>Subhas Chandra Bose</ib> entered Indian politics and <ib>became 
                                            influenced by Gandhian</ib> non-violent movements 
                                            and actively participated in protest marches 
                                            <ib>espousing Civil Disobedience. </ib>
                                        He was one of the <ib>most influential leaders</ib> to organize protests during 
                                        <ib>the Prince of Wales’s visit</ib> to Calcutta 
                                        among the nationwide protests that happened during 1921-22. 
                
                                        <br/> <br/> 
                                        Another dominant influential movement that impacted  
                                        Indian freedom movement was Pan-Asianism that explicitly supported 
                                        revolutionary ideologies. The spirit of <ib>Asia for Asians</ib> or development 
                                        of a <ib>Greater East Asia Co-prosperity sphere</ib> had deep political connections 
                                        to Japan granting Rashbehari Bose political asylum. Rashbehari Bose would 
                                        eventually be granted citizenship of Japan and thus, 
                                        <ib>the pressure to hand him 
                                            over to the British government by Japanese authorities would wane</ib>. 
                                            Rashbehari Bose, Mahendra Pratap, Subhas Chandra Bose and several other 
                                            exiled Indian nationalists would keep the revolutionary movement 
                                            alive through various organizational propaganda. But the real 
                                            push in their favor arrived during the second World War.  
                                        
                                        <br/> <br/> 
                                        By late 1930s, Subhas Chandra Bose, contested the election of  
                                        presidentship of the Indian National Congress in the <ib>Haripura 
                                            Session </ib> and attempted to persuade 
                                        <ib>Congress’ ideological departure from Non-violence</ib>. 
                                        These discussions had emerged during the beginning of World War 2 where the 
                                        <ib>role of Indians cooperating with British war efforts</ib> was being debated. This 
                                        led to Subhas Bose’s ceremonious falling-out with Gandhi and Nehru of the INC. 
                                        This marks a turning point in the Indian freedom movement. Falling out 
                                        with the <ib>Congress leadership was also strategic politically</ib>.
                                        The Congress and the

                                        were engaged in leadership battles and Subhas Bose with an already 
                                        strong support within the INC, mobilized support of the Muslim League
                                        by engaging in local politics and spearheaded the removal of the

                                        in Calcutta. The British authorities saw <ib>Subhas Bose as a serious threat</ib>,

                                        <br/>
                                        In Japan, Rashbehari Bose had been closely following the development of
                                        events. By 1940, he was a <ib>well-respected member of the expatriate</ib> Indian community 
                                        in Tokyo and kept up correspondences with many Indian leaders including those of the INC. 
                                        He <ib>authored articles regularly</ib> in the local dailies in Japan to influence and inform 
                                        the local expatriate Indian community on the goings-on in India. It is suggestive from 
                                        his writings that <ib>although he appreciated Gandhi’s ability to mobilize the masses</ib>, 
                                        he was <ib>let down by the latter’s conciliatory and moderate attitudes</ib> towards the British. 
                                        On the other hand, he had high regard for Savarkar, who by late 1930s had been released 
                                        from prison. 
                                        
                                        <br/> <br/> 
                                        <ib>Rashbehari Bose formed the Indian 
                                            Independence Leagues (IIL)</ib> that mainly comprised of Indian expatriate associations 
                                        in Japan and South-East Asia. In March 1942, Rashbehari organized a conference in 
                                        Tokyo where a resolution to form the Indian National Army, or the Azad Hind Fauj 
                                        was passed. IIL got a big boost after the fall of Singapore when several British 
                                        Indian soldiers became Japanese prisoners of war (PoW), a significant portion 
                                        of whom were swayed 
                                        to alter their allegiance and engage in military combat against the Allied forces 
                                        in the impending Burma campaign. By the end of 1942, <ib>around 40,000 prisoners of 
                                            war had signed up</ib> along with several expatriate Indians, mostly Tamil, living 
                                        in Singapore and Malaya. The objective of the INA was explicitly clear. 
                                        It was <ib>not to replace British colonial rule with a Japanese vassal state</ib>, but to 
                                        liberate India as an <ib>Independent nation</ib>. The INA used Japanese 
                                        official bureau pictorial magazines to propagate and publicize 
                                        its objectives against British imperialism. During WW2, These
                                        magazines had the highest number of circulation[<a href="#R15">15</a>]. 
                                        However, the INA 
                                        <ib>was suffering for a leadership vaccuum</ib>  as Rashbehari Bose’s health was 
                                        deteriorating sharply and in his own words he was willing himself on
                                        with the following words: “I was a fighter. One more fight, the last and the 
                                        best [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. 
                                        
                                        <br/> <br/> 
                                        By 1942, Subhas Bose fled house arrest in Calcutta, 
                                        reached Germany, and formed the <ib>Indian Legion out of 
                                            British Indian PoWs held there</ib>. In early 1942, Bose met 
                                        with Hitler to discuss the latter’s support in Indian struggle 
                                        for freedom. Hitler <ib>held strong racist views towards Indians and was
                                            non-committal to Indian independence from the British</ib>. 
                                        The meeting with Hitler did not precipitate any tangible 
                                        plans and by now, Rashbehari Bose urged Subhas Bose to take over the IIL. 
                                        Traveling safely from Germany to Japan was no easy feat in 1943 and after
                                        a perilous submarine journey Subhas Bose reached Sumatra and from thence 
                                        to Tokyo. In Tokyo, Subhas Bose got acquainted with the Japanese leadership 
                                        [<a href="#R16">17</a>].

                                        <br></br>
                                        In July 1943, Subhas Bose reached Singapore and ceremoniously took over the 
                                        leadership of the INA and the IIL. In October 1943, the formation of the 
                                        <ib>Provisional Govt. of Free India (Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind)</ib> was announced 
                                        with Subhas Bose sworn in as the head of state and premier Rashbehari Bose 
                                        was given the title of supreme adviser. The INA became the official army of 
                                        the Azad Hind Government [<a href="#R16">18</a>]. By November, t
                                        the Japanese-occupied<ib>Andaman and 
                                            Nicobar Islands were handed over to the Azad Hind Government</ib>, thereby granting 
                                        it legitimacy in international law. This episode is extremely important since 
                                        the Andamans were a strategic location in South-East Asian politics, 
                                        and <ib>served as a British penal colony</ib> where several revolutionaries 
                                        including Savarkar were 
                                        jailed being subjected to <ib>most draconian inhuman conditions</ib>. Several 
                                        revolutionaries lost their lives and most of the survivors reportedly 
                                        suffered post-traumatic stress disorder.

                                        While the INA had leadership even before the arrival of Subhas 
                                        Bose, its <ib>explicit role to fight alongside the Japanese</ib> in the 
                                        ensuing Burma campaign was negotiated with conviction by the latter. 
                                        Burma was an extremely important British colony and was 
                                        annexed to the Indian empire post the third Burmese war in 1886, and 
                                        eventually a separate colony in 1937. However, the local Bamar people were 
                                        wary of the Indians in Burma who worked for protecting British interests
                                        and during WW2, they were able to negotiate concessions with the British. 
                                        Burma, served as the gateway to India from the east. The <ib>Chin Hills</ib>
                                        region that were annexed to the British empire during the Third Anglo 
                                        Burmese war, will be the center of conflict between the Japanese forces
                                        and the British that would springboard further campaigns in India. 

                                        
                                        <br/> <br/> 
                                        By early 1944, it was decided that <ib>the INA would fight alongside</ib>  
                                        the Japanese in their offensive campaigns <ib>U-Go and Ha-Go</ib>. 
                                        The Battle-Cry of the INA was <ib>‘Chalo Delhi’</ib> (“March onto Delhi”) 
                                        that evoked a vision of eventually marching into Delhi’s Red Fort – 
                                        the citadel symbolizing united front against British imperialism that 
                                        fell during the revolt of 1857, a symbolism that was derived from the 
                                        revolt of 1857. Netaji envisioned that when the INA would march into India, 
                                        the <ib>entire Indian population</ib> would rise in revolt and 
                                        <ib>spark a nationwide rebellion against the British</ib>.

                                         
                                        
                                        <br/> <br/> 
                                        Although the Japanese were initially successful, the Allied forces 
                                        were extremely agile with their communication lines and moreover, 
                                        the weather was unfavorable to the Japanese and the INA that led to 
                                        their eventual defeat in the Imphal and Kohima campaigns.

                                        The British left no stones unturned to debase defecting soldiers 
                                        of the INA and celebrated victory over the Japanese with much vigor
                                        <ib>as evidenced through special victory propaganda</ib>, philatelic no less. 
                                        Their primary aim was to evoke a negative sentiment against the Indian 
                                        soldiers and gain sympathy from the Indian subjects. This effort backfired. 
                                        When Indians came to learn about the bravery of the INA soldiers, 
                                        they sympathized with them. This led to multiple revolts and strikes. 
                                        The INA soldiers were tried in what came to be eponymously known as 
                                        the INA trials. Public sentiment was in favor of the INA and eventually 
                                        they were acquitted. Nonetheless, their defection would be an inspiration 
                                        for the mutiny in the Royal Indian Navy of 1946. A post-war Britain suddenly 
                                        found it <ib>exceedingly difficult to maintain law and order</ib> in a nation full of 
                                        rebels and realized it would be impossible to suppress a similar rebellion as 
                                        1857. This precipitated Indian Independence on August 15, 1947.

                                            <p>
                                            This operation was a mature culmination 
                                            of prior events during WW1, as during WW2 it was
                                            not about defecting soldiers trying to disrupt order 
                                            in barracks anymore, but it was about defecting soldiers
                                            militarily fighting British forces on Indian soil, 
                                            for Indian independence with tremendous
                                            psychological consequence on an entire population. 
                                            The scale envisioned was, perhaps much grander than the revolt
                                            of 1857. Netaji's biggest contribution was to 
                                            plan and execute such a grand scheme of events.
                                            With only partial success, and backfiring
                                            of British counter-propaganda attempting to denigrate
                                            defecting British-Indian soldiers, the entire nation
                                            became enraged and even the INC that Netaji left due
                                            to ideological differences, would cash in, and emerge
                                            as the leading party to which power would be transferred 
                                            post independence.
