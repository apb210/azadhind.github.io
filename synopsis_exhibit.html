                                        This exhibit is developed in accordance with 
                                        subclass 2C Historical, Social and Special 
                                        Studies category of FIP guidelines to 
                                        narrate the revolutionary armed movement of 
                                        Indian Freedom Struggle using philatelic materials
                                         and ephemera (Fig. 1) spanning Japanese-Occupation, 
                                         Indian, British,  German and Burmese philately (Fig. 2). 

                                        
                                         While majority focus has been given to ca. 1940 onwards 
                                         (hence Endgame), this movement is a culmination
                                          of decades-long endeavors by several revolutionary
                                           thinkers drawing inspiration from movements in 
                                           other parts of the world. Understandably,
                                            significant part of the movement had been 
                                            planned and executed beyond British ruled 
                                            Indian subcontinent. The central idea of 
                                            this story is defection of British-Indian 
                                            subjects to fight for India’s independence. 
                                            This idea was derived from the revolt of 1857,
                                             tried and tested during WW1, and finally succeeded
                                              in spirit and consequences during WW2 with the support of Axis powers.

                                        Geopolitically, the  revolutionary movement had tremendous implications. 
                                        It disrupted British rule not only in India but in other 
                                        parts of the empire through breaking down of peace treaties 
                                        and inciting unrests during WW1. In the WW2 era, it shook 
                                        British supremacy in the Indian subcontinent as the 
                                        Japanese-supported military struggle under Subhas Chandra 
                                        Boseʼs leadership not only recklessly precipitated Indian 
                                        independence, but also made the British aware of the 
                                        power of collective dissent as they were engaged in re-occupation 
                                        efforts of Singapore and protecting other British interests in SE Asia.
                                        This exhibit is unique in comparison to other exhibits on 
                                        Indian Freedom movement that underscore the Gandhian non-violent narrative. 
                                        This is the ONLY comprehensive philatelic treatise on the <ib>
                                        non-Gandhian</ib> Indian freedom movement, 
                                        developed through extensive historical and philatelic research.
                                        Frame 1 chronicles earlier events upto WW1 as Prologue and 
                                        subsequent frames are arranged chronologically highlighting 
                                        important events in Germany and South East Asia. 
                                        Page 8 attempts to bridge a gap of nearly 25 years during 
                                        which key revolutionary personalities were in exile and 
                                        Gandhian non-violent movement dominated the narrative.

                                         <h3>Philatelic Importance</h3> 

                                         Most of 19th century materials used in prologue, highlight 
                                         key aspects of postal systems during military campaigns. 
                                         During WW1, various interesting usages highlight key events 
                                         associated with the revolutionary movement. During WW2, 
                                         items associated with both Japanese Occupation and Allied 
                                         defense have been displayed. Repetitions have been strictly 
                                         avoided and contemporary unused stamps issued for either 
                                         political or propaganda purposes have been included.  

                                        The following (but not limited to) aspects of postal history have been displayed:

                                        Historical and social events narrated here, 
                                        are a result of considerable research translated 
                                        into a philatelic exhibit. There is not a single 
                                        treatise that exclusively narrates the topic of 
                                        this exhibit. Most of the events can be found as 
                                        sporadic events and piecing together a 
                                        comprehensive continuous narrative in the form of 
                                        an exhibit is the novelty. References have been 
                                        made to research articles and recent publications 
                                        on the historical aspects of the subject.

                                        As can be noted, several items have 
                                        been discovered by the exhibitor. Discovery 
                                        has been claimed after thorough survey of 
                                        several important and acclaimed collections made 
                                        in the past. Prominent exhibits, collections 
                                        and works of Masayoshi Tsuchiya, Derek Filby 
                                        , David Tett, Gerald Sattin, Gerald Davis, 
                                        and Dr. Soli Contractor have been carefully studied 
                                        and referenced. Several important sales of 
                                        Japanese Occupation collections and mixed lots 
                                        in auctions have been thoroughly inspected (if possible).

                                    <p>
                                    This exhibit consists of world class rarities of Japanese Occupation and Indian Philately.
                                    Commercially used mails during Japanese Occupation are scarce as 
                                    it spanned only 4 years and postal regulations of one occupied territory
                                    was not necessarily translated into another exacerbated by civil and
                                    military censorships owing to spread of propaganda and misinformation during the war.
                                    During the very short period (1941-45) postal administrations
                                    were severely disrupted and multiple censorships were put in place. Almost
                                    all mails were within the occupied territories as services to and from 
                                    adjacent British, French and Dutch colonies were stopped. 
                                     For members of the Indian Independence Leagues (IIL), mails to 
                                     families in India have not been recorded owing to censorship 
                                     (both Japanese and British). <ib>Interception of telegraphic 
                                        messaging were introduced and the rate was prohibitively expensive. 
                                    This exhibit provides the only recorded evidence of telegraphic messaging 
                                    system by IIL.</ib>
                                     Additionally, correctly addressing letters, 
                                     following constantly changing censorship regulations was a difficult 
                                     task for civilians. The exhibitor has recorded <ib>12 different 
                                        handstamps used in IIL correspondences (required for censorship purposes) 
                                        and all of them have been
                                        displayed in this exhibit. Only one of these have been recorded before
                                        in a collection and the rest have been discovered by the exhibitor</ib>
                                        Correspondences from various camps of the INA are even scarcer. The 
                                        exhibitor <ib>has recorded only 12 camp correspondences</ib>, 10 of which
                                        have been displayed here, 7 of which
                                        belonged to a specialized collection earlier, and the 3 have been discovered
                                        by the exhibitor. Since post re-occupation of Singapore most of INA and IIL
                                        documents and correspondences were destroyed (as per CIA report R&A 3142 S, June 8, 1945),
                                        any surviving mails would be quite scarce and no proper census has been attempted
                                        before. <ib>It is unlikely that the materials shown in this exhibit can be replicated
                                            with ease, as the previous attempt over a period of 40 years yielded only 7 camp mails 
                                            and this is the ONLY comprehensive postal history treatise on this important aspect
                                            of Indian freedom movement abroad and the associated postal history. 
                                        </ib>

                                    Mails from British FPOs during WW2 are 
                                    relatively less scarce, but the choice and discovery 
                                    of mails on specific days of key events, especially in 
                                    the height of disruption of services, makes the task of 
                                    selecting materials infinitely difficult. Eg., mails around 
                                    30-31st of March, 1944 during the Imphal campaigns would be 
                                    extremely rare since the lines of communication had been destroyed
                                     , and telegraphic communications were being set up. 
                                     Such items have been selectively included in this exhibit.
